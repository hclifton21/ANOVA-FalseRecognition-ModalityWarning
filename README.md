# ANOVA-FalseRecognition-ModalityWarning

## Overview
Investigating the Effect of Modality and Warning on False Recognition in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm

## Project Description
Numerous studies indicate the human brain is extremely susceptible to creating false memories. Thus, psychologists have long been intrigued by aspects that influence their prevalence. Past studies have set a standard for examining false memory creation using word lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. However, the current body of research lacks exploration of the interaction between modality and warning on recognition. Therefore, this study explores the effect of simultaneous manipulations of modality and warning on rates of correct and false recognition of studied words in the DRM paradigm. 


# Data 
## Materials & Measures
Four word lists were selected from those created by Roediger and McDermott. Each of the four lists contained 15 words relating to a non-represented critical lure term. For example, a list may consist of the following words: table, sit, legs, seat, couch, desk, recliner, sofa, wood, cushion, swivel, stool, sitting, rocking, bench. These are all related to the word "chair" which was not presented in the list and, thus, not studied by the participants. The four lists were specifically chosen because they tended to elicit the highest average rate of false recognition in previous studies.
For the recognition portion of the study, participants were instructed to circle either “yes” or “no” next to each word, depending on whether they remembered it being presented. The recognition test was scored to measure two dependent variables: (1) the number of correctly recognized list items and (2) the number of falsely recognized critical lure terms. These two measures represent the construct of false memory creation in the DRM paradigm.

## Procedure
In the spring of 2023, students in the Research Design and Analysis class at MSU conducted a study where each recruited four participants aged 18 or older. Sessions took place individually at agreed-upon locations. Participants first received an informed consent document to review and sign, after which the student administrator provided scripted instructions. These instructions varied based on whether the participant received a warning about the potential for false recognition of critical lure terms in the DRM paradigm.

Each participant was presented with four word lists, either auditorily or visually, with each word shown for about 2 seconds and specific pauses between words and lists. The same words and order were used for all participants. Following the word presentation, participants completed a 2-minute math distractor task before moving on to a recognition task, which they completed at their own pace. After the recognition task, participants were fully debriefed about the study's purpose.

Students then scored the recognition task, counting the number of falsely identified critical lure terms and correctly recognized items, with the entire process taking approximately 30 minutes per participant.


# Results
There was substantial evidence of a main effect of warning on the false recognition of critical lure terms. These results support previous findings that warning likely impacts the creation of false memories, but only does so under certain circumstances. Additionally, we advise replicating this experiment with increased controls to mitigate internal validity concerns.
